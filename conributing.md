Introduction
------------

Lolita Framework is an open-source project and anyone can contribute to it. Lolita  contains multiple repositories and they're all stored on Github.

If you feel confident writing code, you can accordingly report any issues you may found or provide pull requests.

We also need help on the documentation. If you see grammar typos or think the docs are lacking of explanation or examples, feel free to complete it:

- [documentation](https://github.com/lolitaframework/documentation)

Reporting issues
----------------

Regarding `code` issues, please **add your code to the request** and give detailed explanations about what you're trying to achieve.

If your code is in multiple files or is more complex, **setup your own repository** so people can look at it.

We highly encourage you to send pull requests with the bug fix. Make sure to work on the latest stable release and **not** the `master` branch.

If you're unsure how to retrieve the latest (tagged) stable release, check these resources:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)

New features
------------

You can make feature proposal from the Github issues.

> Please add the `feature` tag to your request or we won't look at it.

If your proposal is a good fit, you can submit a pull request with the new functionality.
